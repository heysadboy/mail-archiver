# Improvements

Even though the UI is very well planned but some improvements can be made. Here are some of my suggestions.

- Use a calendar date selector instead of an input box to search the date. It would be more user friendly and input will also be more valid in most cases.
- Add language change option. Maybe add i18n to the display option in other languages as well.
- Add option to filter based on sender and receiver along with search date.
- Other option like sorting based on a column is also useful. I have implemented that in the app.
- Overall aesthetic can be improved by using more material components instead of plain design. For example, display search result number in a label, instead of plain text. I use semantic UI to improve the look and also add custom CSS to make it similar to the given result.
